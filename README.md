##Formatting the board
+ Type the board out in a text file starting from the top left corner.
+ Capitalize the letters that you "possess".
+ Multiples lines / white spaces are all right.
+ Standard WordBase Game has 13 rows/10 columns = 130 characters (non white space)
+ Text file should be in same directory as jar-file

Sample text files has been included
